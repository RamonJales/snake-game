# snake-game
  - This is a simple game project using Java's AWT and SWING libreries. My gols are just to put my skills to work. If you want downlaod the game play it    on your computer, copy the code and test it on your computer, share the code, send the game and de code to your friends, you have full right and my consent.
  - Iy is important to note that the images were taken from https://zetcode.com/javagames/snake/, but i studied and made my own game.
  - You, too, can help me by giving advice about the code.
